# ttrss-theme
A tiny tiny rss theme with responsive design, good read experience on mobile phone.

I recently use tt-rss to manage my feeds, with huginn & rsshub to feed other website which doesn't support rss feed. it's a pretty good way to combine all artivle I want to read in one place. The only problem is that tt-rss don't fit the mobile screen, it's reallly hard to read on phone. There are some App can solve the reading problem, but each of them doesn't support the full features with tt-rss, on sime situation I have to manage my feed on the webiste.This is why I wsnt to build the project.
